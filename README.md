# AlgebraicAnimator
A toolkit to create complex animation tree recusrsively from simpler(primitive) animations using algebraic expression. The APIs are functionaly stype wrapper over Qts animation framework. The functional style APIs helps you to define complex animation trees using algebraic expressions from simpler animation tres recursively
